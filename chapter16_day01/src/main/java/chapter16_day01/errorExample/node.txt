in this case,there some disadvantages
	1.daughter request,the determine should in father class rather than
		in client. other request is same
	
	2.We use too many {if...else},if the handler is too many,the code
		readable is terrible
	
	3.The coupling is too serious,we should to according to women 
		status to determine which handler
		
	
	So we can design a request chain,if first condition is don't 
	meet,we pass the request to next object.
